This assignment has been written using Python 3.

The code implements a centralised chat server with the ability to join multiple chatrooms, leave chatrooms and message in chatrooms with all appropriate communication between the clients.



Note:
While this implementation works perfectly well locally, difficulty was had in passing all tests in the automated test server. A long time was spent trying to figure out the exact text responses and order or responses and ultimatly, there was not enough time to solve each one.


**To run the code, run:**
```sh
$ python lab3.py -start 8077 (Or other port number)

"python lab3.py -start 8077" (Or other port number)

Input may be specified as per test server.

**Dependencies**
The following are required to be installed to run the system:
- Python3
```sh
$ pip3 install python3
